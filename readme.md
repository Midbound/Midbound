# Midbound.io

“Midbound” is that special place where inbound marketing meets outbound sales. It is most applicable to B2B companies who generate a lot of great content, which in turn, generates a lot of top-of-the-funnel leads. Those leads aren’t exactly inbound as they are barely considered leads, but they are within your sphere of influence. It’s why we call them *midbound* leads (should they be called prospects or leads?)
